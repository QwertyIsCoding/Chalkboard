Create a web app with the following specifications:

Project setup:
The app will be hosted on vercel
The backedn is hosted on firebase

Three deliverables : html file, css file and js file

Basic featureset:
Create notes
Delete existing notes
Title for notes
Date, time and author for notes

Advanced featureset:
Multiplayer - the ability to create a login code, and share it with another use, and then they both can see the same document. There should be a sync button so that the document can be synced once ready -- it does not have to be real time. Keep track of syncs though -- as in time, etc.

The ability to export notes and an image, pdf or markdown file.

Permanent account deletion -- this should delete account info as well as data from firebase firestone databse

Implement a basic client side encryption strategy -- the key will be stored locally on the machine and the encrypted data will be stored in the cloud. when the user logs in, ask them if they want to set up an encrypted database or not. if they choose to enable encryption, then give them a key to save that they have to enter along with their username and password to decrypt their saved files on the cloud.

UI Elements:
The create notes button should be on the top left and the list of notes should be listed on the left too as a side bar.

The right should include metadata, as in when the document was created (if a document is open) and if it is private, shared, etc. It should include a sync button there if file sharing is enabled.

Accessibility and settings:
There should be a settings page where the user can change the following settings:
Background colour to whatever they want
Font color and style to whatever they want
Text to speech for notes that can be enabled or disabled (if enabled, there should be a button in the notes page when open so that the document can be read to the user)

App setup:
There should be a user sign up page that is done with username and password. then, once the account has been successfully created, they should be automatically logged in into the app and should be set up there. 

Final requests:
Make sure the application has a friendly user interface and is simple to use.
