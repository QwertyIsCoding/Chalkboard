I started out with something that was quite comples -- a note taking app that is completely private and super minimalist. I had features such as encryption and multiplayer planned in mind (some of that code still exists on the codebase) but eventually realized that's going too far form the main idea. Minimalism. I always wanted to be on the cutting edge, be on the newest tech. And I came to realize that doesn't always work and sometimes, you have to take a step back and go slow, and breathe. Remembering too much, hoarding too much, eventually drags you down. Just keep what you need, and let go once it's over. That's about it.
